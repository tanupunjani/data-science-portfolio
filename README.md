# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. These are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks. 

To find out more about my thinking process behing these projects, check out my personal Data science and Machine learning blog here. 

# Contents
- ## Machine learning
  - Columbia University Image Library (COIL-20 dataset) - A model to predict the class of a given image in the using various statistical analysis tools. Built a classifier that performs multiclass classification utilizing machine learning.
  - Mass Spectrometry (Arcene Dataset) - Accomplished the challenge to find feature selection algorithms that significantly outperform methods using all features.

- ## Natural Language Processing
  - [Emotion Detection](https://github.com/tanupunjani/Emotion-Detection) - 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for sentences, without using NLTK's sentiment analysis engine. 

- ## Data Analysis and Visualization
  - [Clothing Fit Dataset for Size Recommendation](https://github.com/tanupunjani/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/EDA%20and%20FE.py) -  Exploratory Analysis and Feature engineering of the modcloth data preprocessing dataset using Pandas, Numpy and scikit learn.
  - [Chipotle sales](https://github.com/tanupunjani/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Getting-to-know-your-data.py) - Understanding the relationship between the data columns and analysing them with Pandas and Numpy.
